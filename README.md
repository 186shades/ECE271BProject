# Evaluation of Different Computer Vision Classification Techniques on Medical Datasets
---
In the evolving field of medical imaging analysis, Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models
have played an essential role in image classification, offering
promising avenues for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
and patient care. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of CNNs and Transformer based-based models
applied to medical datasets, aiming to highlight their respective
strengths, limitations, and applicability. Through a
series of experiments conducted on two datasets, MHIST
and LC25000, we assess these models based on accuracy,
interpretability and robustness to variations in medical
datasets. We explore different techniques to enhance
their ability to learn through transfer learning, augmentation
techniques, and architectural changes. Our findings
reveal that while CNNs exhibit exceptional performance
in capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns
within medical images, Transformer models leverage their
self-attention mechanism, demonstrate a great capability
in handling long-range dependencies and complex pattern.
These two differing perspectives, capturing local and global
contexts of a medical image have proved to be useful in
medical image analysis. The paper concludes with insights
into the future trajectory of model developmenet in medical
imaging, emphasizing the need for models that not only
excel in performance metrics but also align with clinical requirements.
